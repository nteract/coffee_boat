# pyspark-deps
WIP PySpark dependency management.

## Tests

Running tests will modify your current virtualenv's packages. This software is WIP.

## Using

Not in production, please! If you're curious to see how it can be used, check out https://github.com/nteract/coffee_boat/blob/master/Coffee%2BBoat%2BSample.ipynb

For now, stay tuned or join us in hacking!

## Alternatives

Build you own conda env, or use one of the commercial integrated solutions which has a nice UI for this.
